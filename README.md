# About

The following is a simple app which takes in input from the user in a sign up screen and then sends the user 
to a confirmation screen if all of the inputs are correct. The password and email are required fields. 
The `tagetSdk` is 31 (Android 12) and the `minSdk` is 21 (Android 5.0).

# Assumptions

- The debug build has been put in the release for the sake of simplicity.
- The app has also been locked to portrait mode to reduce scope of complexity and due to the simple nature of the app.
- Currently the password serves no purpose (except for ensuring the password field is filled) and is not stored in the user model or anywhere else
